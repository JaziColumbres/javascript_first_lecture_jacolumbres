//examples:
var a;
a= "hello!";
var x, y;
x= 12;
y= 2;
var z= x+y;
//dynamically typed language
//how does it know the type? it disregards depending on situation
//if you put a sting and a integer together, instead of arithmetic, it just sticks the values together (ex: z=a+y : z= hello!2)

//concatenation: concat, when you add something to a string, it becomes a string / combination of strings
var b, c;
b= "hi!";
c= " how are you doing? ^^";
var d= b+c;
//outputs a sentence, example of concatenation

console.log("hello world!");
//so developers can show the errors and display outputs not intended for local users
